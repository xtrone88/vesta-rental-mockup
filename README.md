# vesta-lease-ui

This is a Vue JS site that will connect to APIs generated by Amazon Amplify. It will use stripe for billing and will be backed by the Guesty apis (https://docs.guesty.com/).

To start we will mock up all data that we have not been provided an api for.

The current Templates to reference are at https://xd.adobe.com/view/c27d47f5-6d80-4346-b767-76b807626c4a-972e/grid

The designs currently only explicitly show Desktop views, but the site must be mobile optimized.

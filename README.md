# vesta-lease-ui

Vesta Lease will be an auction style vacation rental platform. It is best summed up as [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/) meets [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/).

## Implementation

This is a Vue JS site that will connect to GRAPHQL APIs generated by Amazon Amplify. It will use stripe for billing and will be backed by the [Guesty APIS](https://docs.guesty.com/).

To start we will mock up all data that we have not been provided an api for.

The current Templates to reference are at

- Desktop: https://xd.adobe.com/view/c27d47f5-6d80-4346-b767-76b807626c4a-972e/screen/27a8e8f4-d16e-4cb6-b027-693835d59530/specs/
- Mobile: https://xd.adobe.com/view/cf49b0fb-5ade-4632-8101-bcfc87f264ca-9a1a/screen/33233ff1-9170-44e9-8566-48304a7bd0d7/
- Mobile design for inspiration from client: https://xd.adobe.com/view/d6822fe2-9c08-4f14-8c73-f6892bdc19f7-83d1/screen/9c7841f7-4c42-4937-b894-2fb8f6c73b2e

The designs currently only explicitly show Desktop views, but the site must be mobile optimized.

## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

1. obtain aws-exports.js and place it at root avoid checking it into this repo.
1. setup .env file

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Plugins in use

- [Veutify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
- [Vue Stripe](https://github.com/morphatic/v-stripe-elements) alternatively use (https://vuestripe.com/))
- [Vue2-google-maps](https://github.com/xkjyeah/vue-google-maps)
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) (please only use for GLOBAL state that should have side effects, don't come up with theoretical side effects, just side effects we need right now, Example logout will need to reset tokens / cookies and disconnect from any websockets for notifications)

### Code guidelines

- Use all lowercase file names preferably using periods for spaces (dot case)
- Use yarn
- Put api mocked up data in src/data directory, when this is live we should be able to delete these if we do not need them for testing.
- Use [Material design icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) first if available, [Font awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) next if they work, if neither work we will consider a custom icon

### Project terminology

#### User Roles

- Lessee: Public user who will use the site to rent a vacation rental
- Lessor: User who owns the vacation rental
- PM: Property manager who will be able to do basically all the same functions as the Lessor
- Admin: Administrator

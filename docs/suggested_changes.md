that page is currently designed as if its on a specific auction

what I would do if this were my idea is show a calendar, that shows both open days and reserved auctions, when you click an auction then it shows the auctions details, if you click and open day it only gives you the option to make an offer.

I am currently working on the assumption that for the entire test period the property is blacked out on airbnb.

so instead of http://vestalease-demo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/properties/5bfc2128885b0100409d1c23 a page showing one auction

my main suggestion is we change it to show multiple

we can still have time on search but the time is really just searching can we book it on our site at all for that time period

so http://vestalease-demo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/locations/New%20Orlean always just shows properties that are available for your date, doesn't show current bid instead shows just the daily rate

we remove all of this stuff:

TAKING POST BIDS
3 days
Ends Mar 11, 2021
Lease Start
Mar 24, 2021
Lease End
Mar 30, 2021

so in this way the site doesn't die if no auctions are happening

I would argue the way to make this whole concept work is you literally buy up blackouts on them all for an event like mardi gras

and it would take a huge seo budget as well

but regardless letting the site do something while not having auctions scheduled seems to me like a great idea

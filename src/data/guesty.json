We alway recommend using Uber and Lyft while getting around the city at night time.","neighborhood":"The home is located in the Lower Garden District! Stately neoclassical mansions, cool cafes, eclectic eateries and homey pubs line oak-shaded streets in the charming Lower Garden District. Handmade jewelry, local antiques and vintage Mardi Gras costumes are on sale at the monthly Little Flea NOLA market, while a stretch of Magazine Street has antiques shops and clothing boutiques. Tiny parks like Annunciation Square and Coliseum Square are local gathering spots.\n\nRestaurants we recommend in the area: \nGris-Gris \nLula \nMeril","space":"Our brand new home has 3 floors and 5 bedrooms - 1 King, 3 Queens and a bunk space!

We have actually taken a step further in battling COVID-19 at no extra costs to our guests. We are sanitizing every surface with special attention paid to high touch areas like doorknobs and light switches. We have also employed a fogging machine that microscopically sprays hospital grade disinfectant in every nook and cranny of the home. And we wash every blanket, coverlet and sheet at every turn, something hotels don't even do! Which means our homes are as clean as they can possibly be! Our houses are also larger than most in the area, requiring more cleaning and a fee that reflects that. We strive to make our homes as affordable, safe and clean as we possibly can!\n\nIf the home requires excessive cleaning, additional cleaning fees will be charged.\n\nHighly recommend Ashton with Jet Set Bachelorette. \nAsk about our gift baskets & luxury robes. Must order 60 days in advanced."},"prices":{"monthlyPriceFactor":0.75,"weeklyPriceFactor":0.85,"weekendDays":[5,6],"guestsIncludedInRegularFee":10,"currency":"USD","basePriceUSD":450,"basePrice":450,"cleaningFee":410,"securityDepositFee":1200,"weekendBasePrice":650},"terms":{"minNights":2,"cancellation":"strict_14_with_grace_period","maxNights":365},"amenitiesNotIncluded":["Crib","Elevator","Game

We have also employed a fogging machine that microscopically sprays hospital grade disinfectant in every nook and cranny of the home. And we wash every blanket, coverlet and sheet at every turn, something hotels don't even do! Which means our homes are as clean as they can possibly be! Our houses are also larger than most in the area, requiring more cleaning and a fee that reflects that. We strive to make our homes as affordable, safe and clean as we possibly can!\n\nAsk about our welcome baskets selections & luxury robes. \nAsk about local recommendations.\nContact Ashton at

We have actually taken a step further in battling COVID-19 at no extra costs to our guests. We are sanitizing every surface with special attention paid to high touch areas like doorknobs and light switches. We have also employed a fogging machine that microscopically sprays hospital grade disinfectant in every nook and cranny of the home. And we wash every blanket, coverlet and sheet at every turn, something hotels don't even do! Which means our homes are as clean as they can possibly be! Our houses are also larger than most in the area, requiring more cleaning and a fee that reflects that. We strive to make our homes as affordable, safe and clean as we possibly can!\n\nIf the home requires excessive cleaning, additional cleaning fees will be charged.","interactionWithGuests":"We're here is you need us but we leave you alone to have fun in NOLA!","summary":"DISCLAIMER: This property does not allow local residents within 60 miles radius, groups under 21 years of age, events, parties (bachelor /bachelorette groups are allowed), photo shoots or gatherings of any kind.

You always have Uber and Lyft but we are located just 3 short blocks from the Canal St. Streetcar line, where you can make going to the the CBD, French Quarter and Uptown extremely easy and quick. We think the Lafitte Greenway is the way to go! We've ridden our own bikes around there and to the FQ! \n\nYou're only 5 minutes away from the Super Dome, 5 minutes away from the French Quarter and Frenchmen Street, 5 minutes away from the Fairgrounds for Jazz Fest and 10 minutes away from City Park to attend the Voodoo Festival!","notes":"If you see our reviews, we have the highest cleaning standards in the area. We have actually taken a step further in battling COVID-19 at no extra costs to our guests. We are sanitizing every surface with special attention paid to high touch areas like doorknobs and light switches. We have also employed a fogging machine that microscopically sprays hospital grade disinfectant in every nook and cranny of the home. And we wash every blanket, coverlet and sheet at every turn, something hotels don't even do! Which means our homes are as clean as they can possibly be! Our houses are also larger than most in the area, requiring more cleaning and a fee that reflects that. We strive to make our homes as affordable, safe and clean as we possibly can!\n\nIf the home requires excessive cleaning, additional cleaning fees will be charged.","interactionWithGuests":"We try to

And we wash every blanket, coverlet and sheet at every turn, something hotels don't even do! Which means our homes are as clean as they can possibly be! Our houses are also larger than most in the area, requiring more cleaning and a fee that reflects that.

It costs $1.25 for 1 ride, $3 for a day pass, and $9 for a 3 day pass. We alway recommend using Uber and Lyft while getting around the city at night time.","notes":"If you see our reviews, we have the highest cleaning standards in the area. We have actually taken a step further in battling COVID-19 at no extra costs to our guests. We are sanitizing every surface with special attention paid to high touch areas like doorknobs and light switches. We have also employed a fogging machine that microscopically sprays hospital grade disinfectant in every nook and cranny of the home. And we wash every blanket, coverlet and sheet at every turn, something hotels don't even do! Which means our homes are as clean as they can possibly be! Our houses are also larger than most in the area, requiring more cleaning and a fee that reflects that. We strive to make our homes as affordable, safe and clean as we possibly can!\n\nIf the home requires excessive cleaning, additional cleaning fees will be charged.\n\nAsk about our welcome baskets selections & luxury robes. \nAsk about local recommendations.\nContact Ashton at http://jetsetbach.com/ for all your party planning. \nAsk about our other SuperHost listings.","houseRules":"Quiet hours 7am-10pm"},"privateDescription":{"directions":""},"pms":{"automation":{"answeringMachine":{"confirmedBeforeCheckIn":{"delayInMinutes":5,"active":false,"message":"Hello, \nWe are currently handling all COVID-19 related trip issues from March 14th -April 16th.

We have actually taken a step further in battling COVID-19 at no extra costs to our guests. We are sanitizing every surface with special attention paid to high touch areas like doorknobs and light switches. We have also employed a fogging machine that microscopically sprays hospital grade disinfectant in every nook and cranny of the home. And we wash every blanket, coverlet and sheet at every turn, something hotels don't even do! Which means our homes are as clean as they can possibly be! Our houses are also larger than most in the area, requiring more cleaning and a fee that reflects that. We strive to make our homes as affordable, safe and clean as we possibly can!\n\nIf the home requires excessive cleaning, additional cleaning fees will be charged.","interactionWithGuests":"We are always here for you if you need anything but try to give you your space!

And we wash every blanket, coverlet and sheet at every turn, something hotels don't even do! Which means our homes are as clean as they can possibly be!

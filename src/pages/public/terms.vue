        <p>Thank you for using Vesta Lease!</p>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between
          you and Lease that govern your use of the websites, applications, and
          other offerings from Vesta Lease (collectively, the “Vesta Lease
          Platform”). When used in these Terms, “Vesta Lease,” “we,” “us,” or
          “our” refers to the Vesta Lease entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom
          you are contracting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lease Platform offers an online venue that enables users
          (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members
          who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for,
          book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations
          (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions, and events
          (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services
          (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a
          “Listing”). You must register an account to access and use many
          features of the Vesta Lease Platform, and must keep your account
          information accurate. As the provider of the Vesta Lease Platform,
          Vesta Lease does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or
          Host Services. Vesta Lease is not a party to the contracts concluded
          directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Vesta Lease a real estate
          broker or insurer. Vesta Lease is not acting as an agent in any
          capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of
          Service (“Payment Terms”). To learn more about Vesta Lease role see
          Section 16.
        </p>
        <p>
          We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like
          our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal
          data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services
          provided to Members by the Vesta Lease payment entities ("Vesta Lease
          Payments").
        </p>
        <p>
          If you Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with
          all laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that
          apply to your Host Services.
